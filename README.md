# Seat-Control-Application-interfacing-with-RTE-AUTOSAR-
               - Developing an application that control seat position (Height-Slide-Incline) in two states:                                      - Manually using three buttons for the three positions. - Automatically using three sensors and three actuators for the three positions.                 - Using “SAAT” tool developed by sprints for RTE APIs generation.                - Communication mechanisms :                                      - Sender – Receiver communication.                                       - Client – Server communication.                                      - Mode Switch communication.                - Using Excel sheet for RTE configurations.                 - Testing the full application on Visual Studio.
